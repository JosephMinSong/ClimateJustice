        Our project aims to study the increasing temperature and severity of heatwaves in the King County area, specifically Seattle. 
        Using temperature data from 2015 to 2024, we have developed a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heat waves in upcoming summer months. 
        This model is intended to protect at-risk and vulnerable communities by providing timely alerts, allowing individuals to seek aid or shelter in advance. 
        Ultimately, our solution could guide the implementation of climate-resilient shelters specifically designed to serve populations more affected by extreme heat events.
