            Our project is dedicated to strengthening the resilience of marginalized communities against the rising threat of extreme heat - 
            these populations include those experiencing homelessness, without air conditioning, or any populations that cannot combat the 
            severe heat. We are emphasizing climate justice by centering our solution to the needs of communities that are most at risk, 
            offering a solution rooted in proactive care and equitable access to climate adaptation resources.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Model Development: Continue refining our model with up-to-date data to improve accuracy and integrate with local alert systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shelter Infrastructure: Identify accessible locations for shelter infrastructure, prioritizing areas with high exposure and high population of vulnerable people to extreme temperatures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Community Partnerships: Partner with community organizations to distribute heat wave alerts and guide the setup of temporary cooling shelters if an extended heatwave is predicted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sustainability and Scale-Up: Develop a framework for scalability to other regions and adaptability for other extreme weather events - such as freeze waves.
