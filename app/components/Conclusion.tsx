        Based on the analysis of Seattle's summer temperature data from June to September, we observed that maximum daily temperatures frequently exceeded ___°F, with daily averages around ___°F. These findings highlight the urgent need for a heatwave early warning system in Seattle to mitigate risks during peak summer months. This system could provide timely alerts to the public and emergency services while enabling proactive measures to reduce heat-related health issues. Elevated temperatures place vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions, at increased risk.
